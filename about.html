          <p>Thiru A.P. Arul Jothi was the only son of Thiru. A.V.Palanisamy Gounder. He was a grand Landlord and also he was known for his social awareness and service at large.. He always thought of the poor and common man’s upliftment. He had conducted many social dramas to educate and eradicate the social evils in the society. Thiru A.V. Palanisamy Gounder was a member of erstwhile Coimbatore District Board. Thiru A.V. Palanisamy Gounder also founded a metal worker’s Co-operative society at Anupparpalayam and helped the workers to free from the Bonded Labour. After his father, A.P. Arul Jothi was elected as successive president. <br><br>

            Thiru. A.P. Arul Jothi was inspired by the deeds of his father and wanted everyone to remember his parents forever. So, he established a Trust in his father’s name A.V.P. TRUST., and in his mother’s name A.V.P. LAKSHMI AMMAL TRUST. He was the founder chairman of both the trusts. Thiru A.P. Arul Jothi was a village Munsif of Chettipalayam in his younger days.

            In commemoration of celebration of SILVER JUBILEE of A.V.P. Trust National Matriculation School during the year 2015, Thiru. A.

            <p>Welcome to A.V.P. College… <br><br>

                Founded in 2015, A.V.P. College is affiliated to Bharathiar University, Coimbatore. Living the vision of its Founder, Late Thiru Aruljothi for whom empowerment of young women through holistic education ignited, the college strives to pass on this torch to its students. A courageous pioneer and a revolutionary in creating the education of women, and deeply rooted in the love for the community, the Chairman Rtn.MD.A.Karthikeyan desires to prepare women in this Institution futuristic especially those on the fringes of society. This institution was created with the objective of providing quality education which will enable students not only to thrive in academic performance but also motivate them towards character building, leadership, extra and co-curricular activities. <br><br>
                
                A.V.P. College aims at forming young women of competence, commitment, compassion, and conscience. This enables students to herald social change – national and global. The college stands committed to make teaching and learning “Student Centric’’ While preference is shown to the educational and cultural needs of the community and the poor girl students socially and financially marginalized, admission is open to all irrespective of caste, creed and nationality. A very strong, dedicated and capable team of educators has always been the driving force in the growth of the college. Currently the college is offering 13 UG and 3 PG programmes. <br><br>
                
                Continuous student-teacher interaction and assessment ensure that students form a meaningful educator-educate relationship with the teachers and are motivated to perform in any platform under their supervision. The Alumni Association of the Institution works in a symbiotic manner with the college for the enrichment and progression of the students. The college believes in balancing tradition and modernity in such a way that the two can co-exist without any contradictions, by continuously updating its value-based education system while being firmly rooted in its heritage. <br><br>
                
                The college provides the better environment and ambience for students to support and promote research and consultancy and innovative learning and teaching practices. A new academic block is under construction this year with a space area of 15,000 square feet for expansion of new courses and classrooms which would be ready by next academic year for the classes to start. The proposed building has a structure of G+ III storied along with the State-of-the-Art College Building that we have already sheltered with the same structure. <br><br>
                
                With the advent of the pandemic situation the college is preparing itself for a blended or hybrid mode of teaching and learning in future. However, we are never complacent, and we constantly improve ourselves, in order to serve the community with the very best education. <br><br>
                
                I am confident that with the blessings of the Almighty, support of the visionary management, students, staff, parents, alumni/ae, well-wishers and benefactors, we will continue to flourish and prosper forever and serve the society at large. <br><br>
                
                Warm wishes and prayers,</p>
